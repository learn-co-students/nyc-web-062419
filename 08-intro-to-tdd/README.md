what is TDD?
  - test driven development
  - series of expectations of code


how to install rspec into any project
  - `$rspec --init`
  - creates the spec folder and the spec_helper.rb

  - `$rspec -fd`

`$rspec` - runs the test files in the spec folder

why do we use it as a tool versus a crutch
  - we use it as an aide for your success and for self evaluation as well as a stepping stone to the solution
  - the problem arose before we had the module system a long time ago, there was an ineffective way for students to compare and contrast how they were doing after a lecture and being given a task
  - the problem still remains if you become overly reliant on the tests and use that as a crutch rather than a guide
  
learn to read the tests, and use them to your advantage
