# Fullstack Auth

## SWBATs
- [ ] Use client-side routing to control user flow
- [ ] Use Bcrypt to encrypt passwords and authenticate users
- [ ] Use `localStorage` to store information on a user's browser
- [ ] Use headers on a request
- [ ] Use JWT to encode and decode information

## Notes
Authorization vs Authentication
Remember Bcrypt?

### Authentication
- connecting to something
- seeing who you are
why?
  - get in and maintain their profile

### Authorization
- permission
- are you allowed to or can you 
why?
  - don't want people to have the wrong amount of access

### Bycrpt
- takes password string -> hash and can reverse

check if state.user is null 
check if localstorage has a userid 
then fetch 





















Deals with passwords and verifying identity

Username is used to identify a user
Password is used to verify that you are actually this user

Proving that someone is who they say they are.

What is the point of Auth?
To get a user in state.


Control what the user experience is (what they see, what they can do)
What information to show (user details)
