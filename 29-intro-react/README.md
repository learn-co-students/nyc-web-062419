- **\_** is a compiler that allows us to write Javascript code using a syntax extension called **\_\_**. It does this by converting this code into a backwards compatible version of Javascript.

- **\_\_**s are functions that return JSX. They are used to encapsulate JSX code that we want to reuse multiple times.

- If a **\_** is written using class-based syntax, it must have a \_**\_ method that returns a single \_\_\_\_** element.

- A component is passed a **\_** object when it is initialized. This object can be used to store information that it's parent component needs to pass to it.
