# Questions

- **\_\_\_** is a compiler that allows us to write Javascript code using a syntax extension called ****\_\_****. It does this by converting this code into a backwards compatible version of Javascript.

- ****\_\_****s are functions that return JSX. They are used to encapsulate JSX code that we want to reuse multiple times.

- If a **\_\_** is written using class-based syntax, it must have a **\_** method that returns a single **\_\_\_** element.

- A component is passed a **\_\_\_** object when it is initialized. This object can be used to store information that it's parent component needs to pass to it.
