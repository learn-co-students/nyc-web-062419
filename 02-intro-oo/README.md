# Intro to Object Orientation

## DRY

- Do Not Repeat Yourself

# What is an object?

- Just a thing
- instance of a thing called a class
- object_id

# How do objects work?

- methods and messages
  - a function that's inside of a class
  - a method is called on an object
  - a message is sent to an object

# What is a class?

- a prototype
- everything
  - built in methods and behaviors

# What is an instance?

- initialize
- getters and setters
- Ruby macros

# Goal: Teach Ruby what a car is
