what would be the best way to implement, after fetch push each element into new array or setting it into an array
  - later retrieval (dog show - form/edit have the object that was displayed and then regrabbed)
    - store a copy - you must always update that master copy 

implement a patch and persist in database
optimistic vs pessimistic rendering
