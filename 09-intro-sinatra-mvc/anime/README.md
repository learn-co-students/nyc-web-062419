## Sinatra & MVC

- What is MVC?
  - Model
    - all things related to our models are found in the models directory
  - View
    - every file and/or directory that builds/edits our html should be found in our views directory
  - Controller
    - communicate between the model and the view
- Convention over Configuration
- What is RESTful routing
  - starts with our domain name/ip address and our path is what comes after
  - for ex: `apple.com` is the domain `/ipod-touch` is the resource/path
- What is Corneal?

## Goal: Build a basic web app
