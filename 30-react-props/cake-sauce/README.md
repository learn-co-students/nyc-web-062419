- Babel is a compiler that allows us to write Javascript code using a syntax extension called JSX. It does this by converting this code into a backwards compatible version of Javascript.

- Components are functions that return JSX. They are used to encapsulate JSX code that we want to reuse multiple times.

- If a component is written using class-based syntax, it must have a render method that returns a single JSX element.

- A component is passed a prop object when it is initialized. This object can be used to store information that its parent component needs to pass to it.
